## Technical design
### Technical design: Overview
BookBase is simple to use. After the user logged in there are 4 pages. First the search page. As its name would suggest, it lets the user search for books. The books then shown in the list are clickable, when the user does click you get to the book detail page. Here you can see the title, cover, authors and description of the book. From here the user is able to add the book to his favorites list. Last, there is a page where you can search a friend and see his favorites list.
Below an overview of the pages. </br></br>
